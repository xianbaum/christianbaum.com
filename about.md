I am a software developer at WR Group. I am a full stack developer who primarily works on back-end. Before that, I graduated from Park University with a BS in Computer Science. As a software developer, I must always learn strive to be the best that I can. I am learning as much I can, and I aim to write the most efficient and maintainable code that I can.

I have many personal projects such as a mobile game called Kat's Dream, a browser extension cat toy, and a browser extension for using Reddit without nonfree javascript. But my biggest personal project I'm working on is a video game with the working title of City Night. 

Other than programming, I love chess, video games, writing, running, improv comedy and travelling.

Most importantly, through my strengths I want to make a difference in this world. I believe in making the world a better place than before we came to it.
